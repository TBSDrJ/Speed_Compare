# Bernoulli Number computations

The goal of this repo is primarily to compare efficiency of different languages in carrying out numerical calculation.  The vehicle I will use for this is testing to go through the Bernoulli Numbers and calculate whether or not they are _irregular_ (see below for details), and, if they are, determine their _index of irregularity_.

I wrote a brief survey of where Bernoulli numbers come from and why and how we might calculate all this stuff [here](Bernoulli.md).
